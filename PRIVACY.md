# Privacy Policy for Pixie

**Last updated:** December 19, 2025

## Overview

Pixie is a browser extension that allows users to pick, copy, and save colors in multiple formats. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

All information (saved colors, preferences) is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's built-in storage (`chrome.storage.local`). This data never leaves your browser.

## Data Sharing

We do not:
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Store any data outside your browser

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To pick colors from the current webpage
- **storage**: To save your color palette locally on your device
- **clipboardWrite**: To copy color values to your clipboard

## Content Script

The extension uses a content script that runs on all URLs to enable the color picker functionality. This script only reads pixel colors when you activate the picker and does not collect or transmit any other page data.

## Data Security

Your data is stored locally in your browser's encrypted storage. Only you have access to this data. Uninstalling the extension will remove all stored data.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
